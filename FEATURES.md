## Platform Philosophy

### What We Are

- **A bulletin board for software** — Post it, price it, sell it
- **Community-driven** — Users police themselves via votes and comments
- **Hands-off** — We facilitate transactions, not relationships
- **Transparent** — Flat commission, no hidden fees, no bullshit
- **Fast** — List in 2 minutes, buy in 30 seconds

### What We're NOT

- **An escrow service** — We move money, we don't hold hands
- **A code review platform** — We don't verify quality
- **Customer support for your purchase** — That's between buyer and seller
- **A refund department** — All sales are final unless seller agrees otherwise
- **Your lawyer** — Do your own due diligence

### The Vibe

Think Craigslist had a baby with itch.io and Gumroad was the midwife. Raw, simple, community-trusted. The kind of place where you might find a gem or you might find garbage — and that's on you to figure out.

## Transaction Flow

### How Money Moves

```
Buyer pays $100
        ↓
    [Stripe]
        ↓
Platform fee deducted ($10 at 10%)
        ↓
Seller receives $90 (minus Stripe processing ~2.9% + $0.30)
        ↓
Seller's Stripe account (instant or daily payout based on their settings)
```

### Fee Structure

| Sale Price | Platform Fee | Seller Receives |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| $1 - $100 | 10% | 90% |
| $101 - $1,000 | 8% | 92% |
| $1,001+ | 5% | 95% |

*Plus standard Stripe processing fees (~2.9% + $0.30), paid by seller from their portion.*

**Why tiered?**
- Small sales: We do the same work, fair to take more
- Big sales: Seller did more work, we take less
- Competitive with alternatives (Gumroad 10%, itch.io 10%, Paddle 5%+)

### Purchase Flow (Buyer)

```
1. Browse/Search → Find listing
2. View listing details, screenshots, comments
3. Click "Buy Now" ($49)
4. Stripe Checkout (card, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
5. Payment success → Redirect to download/access page
6. Get the goods (instant download, repo invite, or wait for manual delivery)
7. Optionally: Vote, leave comment
```

**Guest Checkout:**
- Enter email at checkout
- Download link sent to email
- No account needed
- Can create account later to access purchase history

### Sale Flow (Seller)

```
1. Create account → Connect Stripe
2. Create listing (fill out form, upload files/screenshots)
3. Publish (goes live immediately, no approval queue)
4. Share your listing (we give you the link)
5. Someone buys → Get email notification
6. If manual delivery: Send goods, mark as delivered
7. Money hits your Stripe account
8. Repeat
```

### Delivery Confirmation

**Instant Download:**
- Automatic, buyer downloads immediately
- Marked complete on purchase

**Repository/Manual:**
- Buyer can mark "Received" 
- Auto-marks complete after 7 days if buyer doesn't dispute
- Seller can mark "Delivered" (buyer gets notified)

### After the Sale

- Buyer and seller can continue communicating via DMs
- No platform involvement unless:
  - Fraud reported (fake listing, stolen code)
  - Chargeback initiated via Stripe
- Seller keeps listing active (can sell same thing multiple times)
- Or marks as "Sold" (one-time sale, listing archived)

## Trust & Safety Approach

### Our Philosophy

**Community-first moderation.** We're not the police. We provide tools, you provide judgment.

### Trust Signals (Visible to Buyers)

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| ✓ Verified Seller | Completed sales, established member |
| 👍 47 / 👎 3 | Community sentiment |
| "Member since Jan 2024" | Account age |
| "12 sold" | Track record |
| 💬 Active comments | Seller engages with questions |
| 📦 Instant Download | No waiting, lower risk |
| 🔗 Live Demo | Can see it working |
| 🔗 Public Repo | Can inspect code before buying |

### Red Flags (Buyer Beware)

We may show warnings (not block) for:
- New account (< 7 days) with high-priced listing
- No screenshots or demo
- "Contact Me" pricing on new accounts
- Multiple reports but below removal threshold
- Listing description is suspiciously short

**We show the warning, buyer decides.**

### Reporting System

Anyone can report:
- **Listings** — Stolen code, misleading description, scam, illegal content
- **Comments** — Spam, harassment, off-topic
- **Users** — Fraud, abuse, fake reviews

**What Happens:**
1. Report logged with reason
2. If threshold hit (X reports), flagged for review
3. We review and take action if warranted:
   - Remove content
   - Warn user
   - Suspend user
   - Ban user (repeated/severe violations)
4. Reporter not notified of outcome (no weaponizing reports)

### What Gets You Banned

- Selling stolen code / violating copyright
- Selling malware or malicious software
- Fake listings (taking money, not delivering)
- Review manipulation (fake votes, shill comments)
- Harassment of other users
- Repeated chargebacks (fraud indicator)
- Multiple accounts to evade bans

### What We DON'T Police

- Code quality (that's subjective)
- Whether the price is "fair"
- Personal disputes between buyer/seller
- Whether the project is a "good idea"
- Use of AI-generated code (it's 2025, get over it)

## What We Don't Do

### Things That Are NOT Our Problem

| Situation | Our Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| "The code doesn't work" | Talk to the seller |
| "It's not what I expected" | Should've read the description |
| "Seller isn't responding" | Not our problem (unless fraud) |
| "I want a refund" | Talk to the seller |
| "This is overpriced" | Don't buy it then |
| "The code is messy" | That's subjective |
| "I found a bug" | Contact the seller |
| "Seller is mean to me" | Block them, move on |

### Things That ARE Our Problem

| Situation | Our Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| Seller took money, never delivered | Investigate, ban if fraud |
| Listing contains malware | Remove immediately, ban seller |
| Stolen code / copyright violation | DMCA process, remove listing |
| Harassment / threats | Remove content, warn/ban user |
| Fake reviews / vote manipulation | Remove, warn/ban |
| Illegal content | Remove, report if required |

### The Bottom Line

We built the flea market. We sweep the floors and collect the rent. We don't inspect the merchandise, negotiate prices, or referee arguments. 

You're adults. Act like it.

## Future Considerations

### Maybe Later

- **Escrow for high-value sales** — Hold funds until delivery confirmed
- **Verified code review** — Pay extra for third-party review
- **Auction format** — Bid on listings
- **Bundles** — Sell multiple items together
- **Subscription listings** — Recurring payment for updates
- **API access** — Let others build on our marketplace
- **Affiliate program** — Earn for referrals

### Probably Never

- Refund processing (that's Stripe's job)
- Customer support for purchases
- Code hosting (use GitHub)
- Escrow for every sale (too much overhead)
- Identity verification for buyers
- Review before publishing (kills velocity)
