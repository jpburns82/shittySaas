## What is UndeadList?

A marketplace for indie developers to buy and sell side projects, abandoned SaaS, scripts, boilerplates, and digital products. Think Craigslist meets Flippa — but for vibe coders.

**For sellers:** Turn your dusty repos into cash. List for free, pay 2-6% only when it sells.

**For buyers:** Skip months of development. Find hidden gems ready for a second life.
